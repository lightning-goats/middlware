# Joining the CyberHerd: How It Works

## What is the CyberHerd?

The #CyberHerd is a community of Nostr users who collectively support the ⚡Lightning Goats⚡ project. As a herd member, you'll receive a share of all payments sent to feed the goats every time the feeder is triggered!

**Important: The CyberHerd resets every night at midnight UTC.** All memberships and accumulated zap amounts are cleared, giving everyone a fresh start each day. This means:
- All members are removed from the herd
- All accumulated zap amounts reset to zero
- New daily #CyberHerd note is posted for that day's membership

## How to Join the CyberHerd

The CyberHerd operates continuously with automatic monitoring of Nostr interactions:

1. **Find TODAY'S CyberHerd note**: Look for the current day's note tagged with #CyberHerd from the Lightning Goats project
2. **Zap the note**: Send a zap of 10+ sats to join the herd and earn payouts
3. **Instant processing**: Your membership is processed immediately when detected
4. **Notification**: You'll be notified via public reply when you join the herd

**Requirements for new membership:**
- Valid NIP-05 identifier (your verified Nostr address)
- Working Lightning address to receive payments
- Zap TODAY'S #CyberHerd tagged note with at least 10 sats (older #CyberHerd notes don't count)

**Note**: Only zaps to Lightning Goats project notes are processed for CyberHerd membership. Due to the daily reset, you must use the current day's #CyberHerd note to join.

## Increasing Your Payouts (Existing Members)

Once you're a CyberHerd member, you have **flexible zapping options** to increase your payouts:

### For New Members (Joining):
- **Must zap TODAY'S #CyberHerd note**: New members can only join by zapping the current day's note tagged with #CyberHerd
- **Daily note validity**: Only the #CyberHerd note posted for the current day is valid for joining (older notes don't work due to daily reset)
- **Structured onboarding**: This ensures proper introduction to the CyberHerd system for each daily cycle

### For Existing Members (Increasing payouts):
- **Zap ANY Lightning Goats note**: You can zap any note authored by the Lightning Goats project to increase your payout share
- **No #CyberHerd tag required**: Support any Lightning Goats content - technical posts, goat updates, educational content, etc.
- **Cumulative increases**: Every qualifying zap increases your total contribution and payout share
- **Threaded responses**: Thank you messages will appear as replies to whatever note you zapped

### How It Works:
- **Payment detection**: Only zaps to Lightning Goats authored notes are detected by the payment system
- **Member status check**: System automatically checks if you're already a CyberHerd member
- **Flexible support**: Existing members can engage with the full Lightning Goats content ecosystem
- **Content discovery**: Encourages exploration and support of diverse Lightning Goats topics

## How Payouts Work

**Daily Reset Notice**: Remember that the CyberHerd resets every night at midnight UTC, so all accumulated zaps and memberships start fresh each day.

When the Lightning Goats feeder activates (around 850 sats), payments are automatically split:

- **Only zaps of 10+ sats count** for CyberHerd membership and payouts
- **Only Lightning Goats content** - Zaps to other people's notes don't count
- **Payments when feeder triggers** - You don't get paid immediately, but when the feeder activates
- **Bigger contributions = bigger share** - The more you've zapped, the larger your piece of the 10%
- **Your zaps add up over time** - Every qualifying zap increases your total and future payouts
- **Direct to your Lightning address** - No need to claim anything, payments are automatic
- **Maximum 3 members** - Limited spots make membership valuable
- **90% feeds goats, 10% to herd** - Most money goes to the goats, which is the point!
- **Existing members have flexibility** - Once you're in, you can zap any Lightning Goats content to increase payouts

## How Payments Work

When someone feeds the goats and the feeder activates (around 850 sats), the payment gets automatically split:

- **90% feeds the goats** - Goes directly to goat food and operations
- **10% goes to CyberHerd members** - Automatically divided based on how much you've zapped

### Your Share
The more you've zapped Lightning Goats content, the bigger your share of that 10%! Your payment gets sent directly to your Lightning address when the feeder triggers.

### Simple Example:
- Feeder triggers with 1,000 sats
- 900 sats feeds the goats
- 100 sats gets split among CyberHerd members
- If you've zapped the most, you get the biggest piece!

## Payout Examples

Here's how your share gets calculated:

**Example 1 - Simple scenario:**
- You've zapped 500 sats total to Lightning Goats content
- Other members zapped 300 sats and 200 sats each
- When the feeder triggers with 1,000 sats, you get the biggest share of the 100 sat CyberHerd payout!

**Example 2 - Building your share (existing members):**
- You start by zapping 200 sats to a #CyberHerd note to join
- Later you zap 300 sats to a Lightning Goats educational post (because you're already a member!)
- Then 100 sats to a goat update photo
- Your total: 600 sats = bigger share of future payouts!

**Example 3 - Real payout:**
- Feeder triggers with 5,000 sats
- Your share: ~150 sats sent directly to your Lightning address (based on your contribution ratio)

## The ⚡Headbutting⚡ Mechanism

When the CyberHerd reaches maximum capacity, new members can still join by "headbutting" existing members:

### How Headbutting Works:
- **Zap requirement**: Only zaps of 10+ sats can trigger headbutting
- **Target selection**: You must exceed the lowest contributing member's total zap amount
- **Automatic process**: If your zap qualifies, the system automatically removes the lowest member
- **Instant replacement**: You immediately take their spot in the herd

### Headbutting Examples:

**Scenario 1 - Basic headbutt (new member joining):**
- Current herd: members with zap totals of [1000, 500, 200]
- You zap: 250 sats to TODAY'S #CyberHerd note → You replace the 200-sat member
- New herd: [1000, 500, 250] (you're now in the herd)
- The headbutted member's 200 sats are reset to zero

**Scenario 2 - Failed headbutt:**
- Current herd: members with zap totals of [1000, 500, 200 sats]  
- You zap: 150 sats to TODAY'S #CyberHerd note → Headbutt fails (need 201+ sats to exceed 200)
- You get notified of the failure

**Scenario 3 - Existing member zaps more (flexible content):**
- You're in the herd with 300 sats total
- You zap 200 sats to ANY Lightning Goats note → Your total becomes 500 sats
- Your payout share increases, harder to get headbutted out

**Scenario 4 - Getting headbutted and rejoining:**
- You're in the herd with 400 sats total
- Someone headbutts you out with 450 sats to TODAY'S #CyberHerd note → You lose your spot AND your previous zap amount is reset to zero
- To rejoin: You must start fresh with a new zap to TODAY'S #CyberHerd note that exceeds the current lowest member
- Your accumulated amount from before getting headbutted is completely reset

### Protection Strategy:
- **Build your total**: Multiple zaps accumulate, making you harder to headbutt
- **Monitor the herd**: Check current members' contributions before zapping
- **Stay active**: Regular zapping increases your "headbutt resistance"
- **Risk awareness**: Getting headbutted means losing ALL accumulated sats - they don't carry over if you rejoin

### Headbutting Rules:
- **New members only**: Only new members can attempt headbutting by zapping TODAY'S #CyberHerd note
- **Daily note requirement**: Must use the current day's #CyberHerd note (older notes invalid due to daily reset)
- **Existing member flexibility**: Current members can increase payouts by zapping ANY Lightning Goats note
- **Minimum zap**: 10 sats required to attempt headbutting or increase payouts
- **Amount reset**: When headbutted out, your accumulated amount is completely reset to zero
- **Fresh start**: To rejoin after being headbutted, you start with zero sats and must zap TODAY'S #CyberHerd note again
- **Public notifications**: Both parties receive public reply notifications about headbutts
- **Instant processing**: Headbutt attempts are processed immediately when the herd is full

## System Features

The CyberHerd works automatically behind the scenes:

- **Always watching**: Continuously monitors for zaps to Lightning Goats content
- **Instant updates**: Your membership and contributions are updated immediately
- **Safe and reliable**: Built with safeguards to prevent errors
- **Public notifications**: You'll get public replies when you join, get headbutted, or other important events happen

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your profile**: Ensure you have a valid NIP-05 identifier and working Lightning address configured
2. **Find TODAY'S CyberHerd note**: Look for the current day's #CyberHerd tagged note by the Lightning Goats project (older #CyberHerd notes won't work due to daily reset)
3. **Zap to join**: Send a zap of 10+ sats to join the herd
4. **Handle full herd**: If the herd is full (3 members), you can still join by headbutting out the lowest member - just zap more than their total contribution to TODAY'S #CyberHerd note
5. **Explore flexible zapping**: Once a member, zap ANY Lightning Goats note to increase your payout share and headbutt protection
6. **Monitor the herd**: Check current members to plan your strategy
7. **Stay active**: Regular zaps to Lightning Goats content build up your total contribution and payout share
8. **Daily renewal**: Remember the herd resets at midnight UTC - you'll need to rejoin each day using that day's #CyberHerd note
